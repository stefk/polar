# Polar

[Demo](https://stefk.github.io/polar/)

This app allows you to draw the graph of a function
of a single real variable in both cartesian and
[polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system).

It's mostly built for recreational purposes, though
rendering polar and cartesian graphs side-by-side
offers some insight into the behaviour of a function
and lets you explore directly the mapping between
typical polar figures such as roses or spirals and
their regular cartesian counterparts.

If you're interested in a webgl-based version of
this app, focusing on [parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation)
graphs, see [this](https://github.com/stefk/parametric).
